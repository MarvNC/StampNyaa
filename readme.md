## 🎨 Add Your Own Stickers

StampNyaa supports adding your own sticker packs to the app.

- Simply add a folder to the `stickers` directory in the app's sticker folder, which is located in your `{user}/Pictures` folder by default.
- The folder name will be used as the sticker pack name by default, and the images inside will be used as the stickers.
- You will also need to add a sticker named `main.png` to be used as the icon representing the sticker pack in the sidebar.
- Note that only `.png` images are currently supported.
